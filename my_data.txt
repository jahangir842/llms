This is a sample document about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

RAG is a technique that combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve information from external documents. It works by:

1. Breaking documents into chunks
2. Converting text into embeddings (numerical representations)
3. Storing these embeddings in a vector database
4. When a question is asked, finding relevant document chunks
5. Using an LLM to generate an answer based on the retrieved context

RAG helps overcome the limitations of traditional LLMs by:
- Providing access to custom/private information
- Reducing hallucination by grounding responses in source documents
- Enabling real-time updates without model retraining

This approach is particularly useful for creating chatbots that can answer questions about specific documents, knowledge bases, or private data.
